# The Shattered Constellation Saga

## Premise

In the realm of Aethermoor, seventeen-year-old Kira Nightwhisper discovers she's the last of the Starweavers—ancient mages who could manipulate the very fabric of reality through constellation magic. When the Void Seekers shatter the Great Constellation that protects the seven kingdoms, plunging the world into eternal twilight, Kira must gather the scattered star fragments before the darkness consumes everything.

But the fragments have bonded with other teenagers across the realms, each gaining unique powers tied to their constellation piece. Together, this unlikely group must navigate political intrigue, ancient prophecies, and their own conflicting loyalties while being hunted by the Void Seekers' shadow armies.

As Kira learns to harness her growing powers, she uncovers a devastating truth: the Great Constellation wasn't just protection—it was a prison. And the entity they're trying to keep locked away isn't the true enemy. With each star fragment they recover, they're unknowingly weakening the barrier between worlds, and the real threat lies not in the darkness, but in the blinding light that seeks to remake all existence in its perfect, sterile image.
